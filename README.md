# simple-antenna-simulator
A simple GUI based antenna simulator built with python.

# Dependancies


To be able to run the source code the following must be installed:
- Python (Version 3.8.2 or newer are the only tested versions)
- Special Python Packages Include:
    - tkinter
    - numpy
    - scipy
    - matplotlib

# How to use
Either clone or download 'Antenna Simulator.exe'

Double click on the application to run it, and use the graphical user interface to change antenna parameters. 

All parameters are based on a multiple of the design wavelength. So a conversion must be done to translate design parameters to physical units.

To view a 3-Dimensional plot, click on the `Show 3D Plot` button.

Select simulation type from the drop down menu.

# Usage Disclaimer

This program was written by a group of junior engineers for an "Introduction to Antennas" class at Oregon State University and should only be used as an **education tool**. This program **should not** be used as a substitute for professional grade antenna simulation software. Neither Oregon State University, nor the authors of this program accept any responsibility for the function or misfunction of real world antennas designed from simulations in this software.
